## Overview

This document defines the core architectural principles that guide all design decisions throughout the software development lifecycle. These principles serve as the foundation for evaluating trade-offs, making technology choices, and ensuring consistency across the system.

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns (SoC)

**Principle**: Divide the system into distinct sections with minimal overlap in functionality.

**Guidelines**:
- Each module/component should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- Business logic, data access, and presentation layers must remain independent
- Changes in one layer should not require changes in others

**Examples**:
- ✅ API endpoints handle HTTP concerns, delegate to services for business logic
- ✅ Services contain business rules, delegate to repositories for data access
- ❌ Business logic embedded in controllers or database queries

**Impact**: Improves maintainability, testability, and enables independent evolution of layers.

---

### 2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Principle**: Every module, class, or function should be responsible for one, and only one, part of the system.

**Guidelines**:
- A class/module should have only one reason to change
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Extract complex logic into separate, reusable components

**Examples**:
- ✅ `UserValidator` validates, `UserRepository` persists, `UserService` orchestrates
- ❌ `UserManager` that validates, saves, sends emails, and logs

**Impact**: Reduces coupling, makes code easier to understand and test.

---

### 3. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

**Principle**: Avoid duplication by abstracting common functionality into shared components.

**Guidelines**:
- Identify patterns and create reusable abstractions
- Share common logic through services, utilities, or base classes
- Don't copy-paste code; refactor into shared functions

**Examples**:
- ✅ Single `EmailService` used across all features
- ✅ Common validation rules in shared validator classes
- ❌ Same validation logic copied in multiple places

**Impact**: Reduces maintenance burden and prevents inconsistency.

---

### 4. Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)

**Principle**: Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

**Guidelines**:
- Prefer simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones
- Only add complexity when there's a clear, demonstrated need
- Question every abstraction: "Is this necessary now?"
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - don't build for hypothetical futures

**Examples**:
- ✅ Direct function calls instead of unnecessary abstraction layers
- ✅ Simple configuration instead of complex rule engines (unless required)
- ❌ Premature optimization or over-engineering for future requirements

**Impact**: Easier to understand, maintain, and debug. Lower cognitive load for developers.

---

### 5. Composition Over Inheritance

**Principle**: Favor object composition over class inheritance for code reuse.

**Guidelines**:
- Use composition to build complex functionality from simpler parts
- Keep inheritance hierarchies shallow (max 2-3 levels)
- Prefer interfaces/contracts over base classes when possible

**Examples**:
- ✅ `ReportGenerator` has a `DataFormatter` and `Exporter` (composition)
- ❌ `PDFReportGenerator extends BaseReportGenerator extends Report` (deep inheritance)

**Impact**: More flexible, easier to change, reduces coupling between components.

---

### 6. High Cohesion, Low Coupling

**Principle**: Modules should be highly cohesive (related functionality together) and loosely coupled (minimal dependencies).

**Guidelines**:
- Group related functionality into the same module
- Minimize dependencies between modules
- Use interfaces/contracts to reduce direct dependencies
- Dependencies should point inward (toward core business logic)

**Examples**:
- ✅ `Order` module contains all order-related logic (cohesive)
- ✅ `PaymentService` depends on `PaymentGateway` interface, not concrete implementation (loose coupling)
- ❌ `Order` module directly calling `Database.connect()` (tight coupling)

**Impact**: Enables independent development, testing, and deployment.

---

### 7. Explicit Dependencies

**Principle**: All dependencies should be explicitly declared and injected, never hidden.

**Guidelines**:
- Use dependency injection for all external dependencies
- Avoid global state and singletons
- Make dependencies visible in constructor/function signatures
- Never have hidden imports or side effects

**Examples**:
- ✅ `UserService(Database db, EmailService email)` - all dependencies visible
- ✅ Constructor injection in classes
- ❌ Global `Database.getInstance()` calls hidden inside methods

**Impact**: Makes testing easier, dependencies clear, enables mocking.

---

### 8. Fail Fast and Loud

**Principle**: Validate inputs and fail immediately with clear errors when something is wrong.

**Guidelines**:
- Validate inputs at boundaries (API, function entry points)
- Use explicit error types, not generic exceptions
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Don't silently handle errors that should bubble up

**Examples**:
- ✅ Validate request body at API boundary, return 400 with details
- ✅ Throw `InvalidEmailError` with specific message
- ❌ Silently returning `null` for invalid input

**Impact**: Easier debugging, prevents corrupted state, clearer contracts.

---

### 9. Immutability by Default

**Principle**: Prefer immutable data structures and avoid mutating state.

**Guidelines**:
- Use immutable data structures where possible
- Return new objects instead of modifying existing ones
- Mark mutable operations clearly
- Avoid shared mutable state

**Examples**:
- ✅ `const updatedUser = { ...user, name: newName }` (creates new object)
- ✅ Functions that return new values instead of modifying parameters
- ❌ Functions that mutate their input parameters

**Impact**: Predictable state, easier reasoning, fewer bugs from side effects.

---

### 10. Testability First

**Principle**: Design code to be easily testable from the beginning.

**Guidelines**:
- Write small, focused functions that are easy to test
- Avoid hidden dependencies and global state
- Use dependency injection to enable mocking
- Design for both unit and integration testing

**Examples**:
- ✅ Pure functions with clear inputs/outputs
- ✅ Services with injected dependencies that can be mocked
- ❌ Functions with hidden database connections or external API calls

**Impact**: Higher test coverage, confidence in changes, better code quality.

---

## Quality Attributes

### Performance

**Principles**:
- Measure first, optimize second
- Optimize for the common case
- Consider performance implications in design, but don't prematurely optimize

**Metrics**:
- Response time: p95 < 200ms for critical paths
- Throughput: Support projected peak load + 50% buffer
- Resource usage: Monitor memory, CPU, and network utilization

---

### Security

**Principles**:
- Defense in depth
- Never trust user input
- Principle of least privilege
- Fail securely

**Guidelines**:
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Log security events for audit trails

---

### Scalability

**Principles**:
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Statelessness where possible
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Database optimization from the start

**Guidelines**:
- Use stateless services

- Resource-based URL structure: `/users/{id}/orders`
- Consistent response formats
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Version APIs: `/api/v1/users`

**GraphQL Considerations**:
- Use for complex, nested data requirements
- Avoid N+1 query problems
- Implement proper error handling
- Use subscriptions for real-time updates

---

### Database Design

**Principles**:
- Normalize to 3NF unless there's a performance reason
- Use indexes strategically
- Plan for data migration from the start
- Implement soft deletes where appropriate

**Guidelines**:
- UUIDs for distributed systems
- Timestamps for all records (created_at, updated_at)
- Foreign key constraints
- Consider partitioning for large tables

---

### Frontend Architecture

**Component Principles**:
- Container vs. Presentational components
- Single Responsibility per component
- Reusable UI components
- State management at appropriate level

**Performance**:
- Lazy loading for routes/components
- Code splitting
- Asset optimization
- Virtual scrolling for large lists

---

## Decision Framework

When making architectural decisions, follow this process:

### 1. Identify the Problem
- What are we trying to solve?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the success criteria?

### 2. Gather Options
- List at least 2-3 viable approaches
- Consider build vs. buy vs. adapt
- Research industry standards

### 3. Evaluate Against Principles
- How does each option align with our design principles?
- What are the trade-offs?
- Consider short-term vs. long-term implications

### 4. Document Decision
- Record the decision with rationale
- Include alternatives considered
- Note any deviations from principles with justification

### 5. Review and Approve
- Peer review for significant decisions
- Document in ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
- Communicate to team

## Trade-off Matrix

When principles conflict, use this prioritization:

| Priority | Principle | When to Prioritize |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Security | Always - non-negotiable |
| 2 | Correctness | Always - must work correctly |
| 3 | Testability | Early development, critical paths |
| 4 | Simplicity | Most cases, avoid over-engineering |
| 5 | Performance | When measured bottlenecks exist |
| 6 | Reusability | When duplication is proven, not anticipated |

**Note**: This is a guideline, not a rule. Context matters. Document exceptions.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Architecture Smells

1. **God Object**: A class that does too much
   - **Detection**: >500 lines, >10 responsibilities
   - **Fix**: Split into focused classes

2. **Circular Dependencies**: A → B → A
   - **Detection**: Import cycles
   - **Fix**: Extract common dependency

3. **Shotgun Surgery**: One change requires many modifications
   - **Detection**: Single requirement touches many files
   - **Fix**: Improve cohesion

4. **Feature Envy**: Module uses another's data more than its own
   - **Detection**: Excessive method calls to another object
   - **Fix**: Move method to the data owner

5. **Duplicate Code**: Same logic in multiple places
   - **Detection**: Similar code blocks
   - **Fix**: Extract and reuse
