## Quick Reference

### 10 Core Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** - Code must be clearly separated by layers/modules
2. **Single Responsibility (SRP)** - Each component/function does one thing
3. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** - Abstract repeated logic
4. **Keep It Simple (KISS)** - Prefer simple solutions, avoid over-engineering
5. **Composition Over Inheritance** - Use composition instead of deep inheritance
6. **High Cohesion, Low Coupling** - Related functionality together, minimal dependencies
7. **Explicit Dependencies** - All dependencies declared and injected
8. **Fail Fast** - Input validation, immediate failure with clear errors
9. **Immutability by Default** - Prefer immutable data structures
10. **Testability First** - Design for easy testing

### Usage

When you need language-specific examples:
1. Identify the principle you want to apply
2. Check the corresponding language example file
3. Copy the pattern that fits your use case
4. Adapt to your specific requirements

### Example Search

```bash
# Find all examples for a specific principle
grep -r "Explicit Dependencies" architecture/examples/

# Find examples in a specific language
cat architecture/examples/typescript/README.md | grep -A 10 "SRP"
```
