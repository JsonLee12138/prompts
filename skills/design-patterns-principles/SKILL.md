# Design Patterns & Principles

## Overview
Provide concise, consistent explanations of patterns and principles using local reference documents.

## Quick Workflow
1. Identify scope: patterns, principles, or both.
2. Load relevant references: `references/design-patterns.md` and/or `references/design-principles.md`.
3. Respond in Chinese with short sections.

- For patterns: 定义 / 适用场景 / 优缺点 / 典型实现
- For principles: 定义 / 适用场景 / 落地要点

4. If the user asks for depth or concrete examples, ask one clarifying question before expanding.

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing architecture patterns with design patterns. If the request is about system architecture, clarify scope first.
- Mixing pattern names. Verify the pattern exists in the references before answering.

- `references/design-patterns.md`
